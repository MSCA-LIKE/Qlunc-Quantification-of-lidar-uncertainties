## Tutorial1:
This tutorial aims to facilitate the introduction to Qlunc. 
Will go through the code and create a lidar device with its modules and components. Will ask for uncertainties either lidar general one or component specific uncertainty. We will see some graphical interesting results. Will see how to access design lidar data.

## Try it yourself:

## Tutorial2:
Along `Tutorial1` we learn how to create a lidar device. In `Tutorial2` we design two lidar devices and compare against each other. These devices differ from each other just in the scanner head, so we will build up two optic modules by changing the scanner component.
