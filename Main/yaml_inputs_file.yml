# Yaml inputs file:

# DIRECTORIES:------------------------------------------------------
# Template for Qlunc inputs. Here we include a list of the inputs to run Qlunc (Quantification lidar uncertainties).

Main_directory: '../GitHub_Qlunc/'

# MODULES-----------------------------------------------------------
# Modules to include in estimations: Modules is a dictionary containing the lidar modules as a key. 
# As values there is a nested dictionary containing components as keys and type of uncertainty as values.
# Each of this values is related with a function which calculates this specific uncertainty. 
# The relation between type of unc. and function calculating it is in LiUQ_core when defining methods.

modules:
# In modules (modules as defined in OpenLidar architecture) user can include wich modules want to include in the estimations. In each module user will include the 
# name of the component and  the name of the uncertainty (eg "Power" - "Power_source": - "Power_source_noise")  
  OpticalCirculator:
    
    name:
    - OC_YAML
   
    insertion_loss:
    - [2.1]
    
    
    Converter: # for now Converter_noise and Converter_losses
    - Converter_noise
    - Converter_losses
  
  Photonics: # for now:'photodetector_noise'; May be include 'TIA_noise' if there is a transimpedance amplifier...
    
    Photodetector:
    - Photodetector_noise
    
    Optical_amplifier:
    - Optical_amplifier_noise #for now:  'Optical_amplifier_noise',... If user includes Optical_amplifier component in dictionary 'modules', figure noise is automatically included in calculations(if don't want to include it have to put 0 in 'Optical_amplifier_uncertainty_inputs')
    - TIA_noise
    
    Laser_source:  # for now:'laser_source_noise',...
    - Laser_source_noise
  
  Optics: # for now:'telescope_noise', 'telescope_losses'...
    
    Telescope:
    - Telescope_losses
    - Telescope_noise
