Qlunc is softare that aims to quantify errors when measuring with a lidar device. 

The code is objected oriented within the creation of python objects simulating real lidar components, building up a lidar digital twin. The user creates an instance of
each lidar component,including its functional parameters, and also can define the function is used to obtain the specific uncertainty of the component. Then, each module
is
